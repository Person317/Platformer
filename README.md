Coded main character, edited the whole level, and made it to where if you falloff the platform you die

## Reflections
Somthings that were easierwere the apperance overall, like makeing the character animations and making the level via tile maps. Somthings I found difficult was the coding aspects since im not that good at it but the videos help some, like with the character flipping and movement like running, videos helped me with that. I also found the git hub functions a bit confusing but I figured it out. I had to cut somethings out like enemies and coins due to lack of time and make this kinda of more like a parkour game instead of a 2d platform. I also had to pivot from missing almost a week due to sickness. All in all I learned the value of time management and learned newthings about delvopment as a whole in terms of a game.
